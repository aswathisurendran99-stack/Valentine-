    <h1>To my everything,</h1>

    <p>
      I will always choose you, not just on the easy days, but on the days we don’t understand each other, when words come out wrong and silence feels heavier than it should. Even when there’s distance between us, even when life pulls us in different directions, I still reach for you. Because love isn’t proven in comfort. It’s proven in effort, in patience, in staying.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are the only heart I want beside mine at the end of all this. The only soul I want to grow old with, misunderstandings and all. I didn’t fall in love with perfection. I fell in love with your effort, with the way you stay even when it’s hard. And I promise you, I’m staying too. Every version of us is worth it.
    </p>

    <p>
      One day, I will marry you. I want a life with you, kids, loud mornings, quiet nights, and a home that feels safe. I want to travel, get lost, grow tired, and still choose you every single time.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope soon we won’t have to miss each other like this anymore. No more counting hours. No more waiting for calls. Just your breath steady with mine, and the peace of knowing this love is finally home.
    </p>

    <p>
      And lastly, I need you to know this I am soooo proud of you. The world may not see the battles you’re fighting, but I do. I see how hard it is for you to keep going, and I see how you still give everything you have. Thank you for holding on. Thank you for doing your best even when it feels like no one notices. Please hang in a little longer. I promise you, all of this will be worth it in the end.
And Whatever happens you are always my Chunniimonnn….
